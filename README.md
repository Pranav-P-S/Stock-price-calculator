## How It Works

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures all inputs are numeric and within valid ranges.
2. **Calculations**:
   - **Investment**: Calculated as `Current Price × Number of Shares`.
   - **Profit/Loss Selling Price**:
     - Factors in both fixed and percentage-based brokerage fees.
     - Considers desired profit or loss percentages.
   - **Brokerage Threshold**: Determines whether to use fixed or percentage-based brokerage.
   - **Final Profit/Loss**: Considers total costs and fees for accurate results.
3. **Dynamic Output**: Updates the GUI with calculated values in real-time.
